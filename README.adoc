= uchoose


Let you choose the browser or action when openning a URL instead your "default browser" configured on the system, setting the uchoose as your new default browser (URL opener).

It uses the Freedesktop XDG Desktop files and Python, so just work on GNU/Linux by now.

Current interfaces:

* CLI (basic)
* QT

== WIP

This is work in progress
